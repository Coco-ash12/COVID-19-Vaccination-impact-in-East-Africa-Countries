This project aims at highlighting the influence of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing the mortality rate of COVID-19 in East Africa.
Combined and derived metrics were sourced, then cleaned of irrelevant data with MS Excel, while pgAdmin4(PostgreSQL) was used to edit queries for data exploration and data visualization was done with Tableau.

|Total Tests	| Total number of Covid tests done|
|Tests_per_1Mpop	| Covid tests done per 1 million of the population|
